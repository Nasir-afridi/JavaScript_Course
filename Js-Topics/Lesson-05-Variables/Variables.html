      //there are three ways to create a variable in js "1.let 2.const 3.var"
      // we use let when we know that it value will be change later.
      // we use const by default when we know that it value will not change later.
      // var is a orignal way to create a variables in js var = variable but it has some issuses

      // typeof tells us what type a value is we see below in many e.g

      console.log(typeof 'hello');
       //it create a container named variable1 inside this container or variable we store its value 3
      let Variable1 = 3;
      console.log(Variable1);

      //it can add 2 + 2 and stores the value 4 inside the calculation container
      const calculation = 2 + 2;
      console.log(calculation + 2) 

      //in this case the calculation value 2 + 2 = 4  + 2 = 6 is stored in variable result.
      const result = calculation + 2;
      console.log(result);

      //we can also store a strings inside variable
      const message = 'hello';
      console.log(message);

      //js has a feature called "semicolon insertion" means it will try to insert the last semicolon in a code automatically that's why if we dont put a semicolon in the end of the console it will automatically add
       console.log('2');console.log(';')

       //reassign a value to a variable
       Variable1 = 2+2;
       console.log(Variable1);

      //in this case variable1 value is 4 and adding 2 in it = 6 and the variable1 stores 6 again 
      Variable1 = Variable1 + 2;
      console.log(Variable1); 
      
      variable2 = Variable1 + 30;
      console.log(variable2);
