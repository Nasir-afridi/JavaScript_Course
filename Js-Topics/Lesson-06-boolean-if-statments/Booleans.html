    //it is also called equality operator double equals convert both values into the same type it will convert both of these into nmbrr 5 and then compare.it is not good because one value is number and second one is string.
    console.log(5 == '5.0');



    
    //comparison operators have lower priority then math operators
    console.log(3 > 5 - 5);//it wil minus the 5-5 ans is 0 and then it compare .




    //The === operator in JavaScript is called the strict equality operator. It checks if two values are equal, both in value and type. This means that it not only checks the value of the two operands but also checks if they are of the same data type.
