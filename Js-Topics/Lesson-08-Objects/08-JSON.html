    /* 
      JSON does not support single quotes.and it does  not     support functions.it is a syntax that is similiar to JavaScript but with less features.

      **why we use json syntax instead of js obect syntax?**
      1.A js object only make sense in js.
      2.Jason syntax is understood by every programming language.that why json syntax is more universal.

      ** we use JSON**
      -When we send data between computers.
      -when we store data.

      ** Built-in JSON Object.**
      it convert : "Js-object into JSON" and "JSON into Js object".

      **Next built-in object**
      1.Local storage: save values more permanently.it only support strings.
    


      we convert Js-object into JSON
      const product = {
          Name: 'Socks',
          Cost: 1000
      };
       console.log(JSON.stringify(product));

       convert json into js-object.
       const jsonstring = JSON.stringify(product);
       console.log(JSON.parse(jsonstring));

      localStorage.setItem('mes','22');
      console.log(localStorage.getItem('mes'));
    



      
      objects have property and methods but other values also have properties and method.and these properties are string not object.Js has a special feature called "auto-boxing".js automatically wraps this string in a special object and this object has a properties lenght,uppercase etc.it is done automatically.lenght property tells us how many characters or letter does hello string.Uppercase can convert all of these in the large words e.g HELLO.
      


      console.log('hello'.length);
      console.log('hello'.toUpperCase());
    */




    /*
      below we can equal object2 to 1.in this case the code save in object1 does'nt make a copy of this.it just makes a copy of reference that point to the object.js doesnot copy the entire code its just copy the reference of the object which is much faster.this is called "copy by reference".
    


      const object1 = {
        message:'hello'
      };

      const object2 = object1;
      


      notice that we can change the value of object and at the top we can declare it with const.that because this variable just contains a reference that points to the object.const can only change the reference in the variable.


      object1.message = 'Good Job!';
      console.log(object1);
    

      we cant compare objects directly.if we give a same value that i can give to a object1 and equals it it cannot show the result in true because objects does not see the values orr differentiate b/w values it can do it b/w references.

      const object3 = {
      message:'Good job!'
      };
      console.log(object3 === object1);
    */

    

      /*  **shortcuts for objects**  
      if the variable name and property are same that we can see below we use the shortcut.this shortcut is called destructing.
      */
    const object4 = {
      message:'Good job!'
    };

    //const message = object4.message;
    const {message} = object4;
    console.log(message);
