    //An object groups multiple value together. we can save an object inside a variable.it also allow us to use  multiple value together.inside an object we can save any type of value.

    /* JSON does not support single quotes.and it does not support functions.it is a syntax that is similiar to JavaScript but with less features.*/



    /* why we use json syntax instead of js obect syntax? 
       1.A js object only make sense in js.
       2.Jason syntax is understood by every programming language.that why json syntax is more universal.

       we use JSON
       -When we send data between computers.
       -when we store data.
